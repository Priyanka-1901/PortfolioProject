Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this portfolio:

1. Covid_data_analyses : 
●	Conducted data exploration and cleansing of Covid-19 data using SQL, which involved cleaning and organizing the raw data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
●	Utilized Tableau to create an interactive and engaging visualization that provides insights into Covid-19 related metrics such as continent-wise
death numbers and global death statistics.


2. Housing_data_cleaning : 
● Imported the raw housing data into a SQL database, ensuring that all data types and formats were properly specified
● Performed initial data exploration and analysis to identify potential issues with the data, such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistent data types
● Cleaned and transformed the data using SQL queries to prepare it for analysis, including:
    Removing duplicates and invalid or irrelevant records
    Handling missing values by imputing or deleting them as appropriate
    Correcting inconsistent or erroneous data, such as misspelled city names or incorrect property types
    Normalizing and standardizing data where necessary, such as converting string values to uppercase or lowercase


3. Movie Correlation Project : 
●	Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and exploration using Python, resulting in a dataset of over 10,000 movies with accurate and standardized information.
●	Utilized statistical analysis to uncover significant correlations between movie votes and budget to box office revenue, with these findings strategic decisions
can be made by future film production.
●	Generated clear, visually engaging plots to communicate complex findings from data analyses to non-technical stakeholders, which can result in increase of 
understanding and can be used to take more informed decision.


4. CodeX_Marketing_Team_Insights :
I have analyzed the survey results conducted by CodeX, a German beverage company, to gain meaningful insights for their Marketing team. As a marketing data analyst, I transformed the data using SQL and derived key findings to drive actionable strategies.
